        Zig-Zag rolling papers. It was recorded by Dr. Dre following his departure
        from hip hop group N.W.A in April of 1991 and its label Ruthless Records over
        a financial dispute, and consequently features both subtle and direct insults
        at Ruthless and its owner, former N.W.A-member Eazy-E. Although a solo album,
        it features many appearances by Snoop Dogg, who used the album as a launch
        pad for his own solo career.\n\nUpon its release, \"The Chronic\" received
        positive reviews from most music critics and earned considerable sales success.
        The album peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and has sold over three
        million copies, which led to Dr. Dre becoming one of the top ten best-selling
        American performing artists of 1993. Dr. Dre''s production has been noted
        for founding and popularizing the G-funk sub-genre within gangsta rap. \"The
        Chronic\" has been widely regarded as one of the most important and influential
        albums of the 1990s and regarded by many fans and peers to be one of the most
        well-produced hip hop albums of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number
        138 on Rolling Stone magazine''s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.
